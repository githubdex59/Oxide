## Installation

Install Oxide with the built in script
Run from inside the downloaded source
```bash

**DO NOT RUN release/build.sh - IT WILL NOT WORK**

## Features

- Variable mutations can be reverted
- Anything you can do in java you can do in Oxide, even use Kotlin libraries🤮


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

Currently if you want to contribute I'll just read the pr and accept or not, at some point there'll be a contribute.md but I cannot be bothered to do it right now


## FAQ

#### Is this just Java

Well yes but actually no, it transpiles to java but there is a distinction

#### Who are you and why are you in my house

Next question please
